\noindent
Short chapter with informal overview of challenges and goals. This should mostly answer the
question: \emph{Why does this thesis exist?} I would defer a more technical explanation of
background and challenges to \cref{chp:background}.

\section{Networking and Quantum Networking}

Give a layperson's overview of networking-related computer science and quantum
information/networking, and informally introduce the reader to the challenges of applying the former
to the latter.

\section{Research Goals and Methodology}

Succinctly list main research questions and goals. Also, clarify scope of thesis, stating that we
took an implementation- and experiment-driven approach, rather than a more fundamental one.

\section{Thesis Outline}

List and brief overview of chapters that follow.
