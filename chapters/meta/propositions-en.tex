\begin{enumerate}[widest=10]
    \item Quantum networks can only become a commercially viable product if the nodes thereof can be
          programmed with platform-independent software.
    \item The overhead incurred by software abstractions for quantum network nodes does not affect
          the nodes' ability to establish entanglement with one another.
    \item Multi-tasking operating systems are not only beneficial, but also essential, for the
          operability of multi-user quantum networks.
    \item Packet switching routing schemes will eventually outclass resource allocation methods
          based on path reservation in quantum networks.
    \item The scientific integrity of a doctoral candidate must never be taken for granted, and
          should instead be trained and assessed by an independent committee.
    \item From time to time, it is important to remind ourselves that among the main factors driving
          technological progress are wars and the porn industry.
    \item Any definition of what constitutes a work of art on the basis of (subjective) beauty,
          market value, technique, medium, the artist's status, or even the artist's sentience, is
          bound to become obsolete some time later in history.
    \item Short-duration sustainability initiatives, like the \emph{national meatless week}, do not
          have any measurable long-term impact, and as such are useless.
    \item To try solving the climate crisis, we should consider having fewer heterosexual,
          cisgender, white men in power.
    \item Magritte's \emph{pipe} is, in fact, a pipe.
